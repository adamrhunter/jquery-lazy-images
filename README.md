# jquery-lazy-images

jQuery plugin for lazy-loading of images. Why download what you can't see?

## Installation

### Rails 3.1 or greater (with asset pipeline *enabled*)

The jquery-lazy-images files will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use. If they're not already in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` by default, add these lines:

```js
//= require jquery-lazy-images
```

### Rails 3.0 or earlier (or without asset pipeline)

Support coming soon.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Mika Tuupola for creating [jquery.lazyload.js](http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload)!
This gem bundles that library, and he's done most of the hard work for us.
